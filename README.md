# Election_Analysis

##Overview 
Now that you have seen the dataset, you're going to sit down with Tom to go over the tasks that need to be completed for the election audit, and discuss the information needed by the Colorado Board of Elections.
In this project, our final Python script will need to be able to deliver the following information when the script is run: 

Total number of votes cast
A complete list of candidates who received votes
Total number of votes each candidate received
Percentage of votes each candidate won
The winner of the election based on popular vote
